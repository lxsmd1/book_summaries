# The Go-Giver

A book about a powerful business idea and the shift in mindset it takes to get the results you are after.

## The five laws of stratospheric success:

1. Value: Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.
2. Compensation: Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.
3. Influence: Determined by how abundantly you place other peoples interests first.
4. Authenticity: The most valuable gift you have to give is yourself.
5. Receptivity: The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.

## Expanded

1. Value: How is value measured?

Value is not equivalent to all people. You can do a good turn that you think is small and it may turn out to be the best favor you do for someone.
