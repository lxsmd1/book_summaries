## Concepts
### Chapter 1: Overview and Summaries
* Are cities a type of organism, as they are a result of biological processes, humans?
* Is there a formula to predict the success of a business and its energy requirements?
* Energy and itâ€™s sources
* Metabolism as the process of converting all energy into useful work
* Limits and thermodynamics
* Entropy: Byproducts from metabolism, inevitable and universal. Some disorder will occur and increase due to scale.
* Complexity and the result is different than the sum
* Emergence and how small actions self assemble from a few basic rules
* Linear vs Exponential behaviors
* Economies of scale are not all economies and need to be properly studied.

* Ch 7: Scaling law
	* Non-linear power laws plotting on log scales
	* 3/4 rate for metabolism
	* Kleiber's law for metabolic rate: Is an example of this phenomenon stating that as the size of an animal doubles, ex. 5 lbs => 10 lbs, the energy required to support that animal is increased by only 75% not 100% as would be thought of if you were using linear formulations.
	* This savings also translates to a 25% reduction in cell damage. This is key to proving why elephants and whales have very few occurrences of cell damage from metabolism. As the animal gets larger less energy is required proportionally therefore less damage occurs from its use.
* Why do we stop growing even though we keep eating? Why do trees not grow a mile tall?
	* Sub linear scaling of metabolic rate and the economies of scale in the network of design is the answer.

* Ch 8: Consequences and Predictions
	* While there are gains from the efficiency of scale, ex. Cities, there are also increases in negative aspects such as crime or disease.
	* These follow super linear patterns where the multiplier is greater than 100% when you double in size.

* Ch 9: Towards a science of companies
	* Companies scale as a function of power laws.
	* Scaling power laws:
		* Companies => 0.9
		* Organisms => 0.75
		* Cities => 0.85
	* More constraints are present in the beginning but they even out over time.
	* 50% of all companies are fail at 10 years or before
	* The growth and mortality of companies are most comparable to that of organisms.

### Chapter 2: Concepts and Overview
* The science behind Godzilla why it was not possible.
* Galileo showed proof that the weight of that large an animal would be crushed by its own weight.
* There are fundamental constraints that will limit the size of all physical scale.
* Areas and volumes have laws of scale.
	* when scaling the size of an object, if all the proportions of dimensions remain fixed then the
		* area of the object is squared
		* volume of the object is cubed
		* 1 ft square
			* area = 1 ft squared
			* volume = 1 ft cubed
		* Volumes increase a much faster rate than the area.
